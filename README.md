# 🧬 Cancer Diagnosis Data Analysis with Power BI and Python

This project is a comprehensive analysis of a breast cancer dataset using Power BI and Python. The dataset includes various features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. The main objective is to explore the relationships between these features and cancer diagnosis using visual and statistical tools.

## 📊 Tools Used

- **Power BI**: For interactive dashboard creation and data visualizations.
- **Python (in Power BI)**: For generating correlation heatmaps using seaborn and matplotlib.
- **Pandas**: For preprocessing and cleaning data (optional before importing to Power BI).
- **Seaborn/Matplotlib**: For visualizing feature correlations.

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: [YBI Foundation GitHub](https://github.com/YBIFoundation/Dataset/raw/main/Cancer.csv)
- Attributes include:
  - Mean, Standard Error, and Worst values for: `radius`, `texture`, `perimeter`, `area`, `smoothness`, etc.
  - `diagnosis`: Target variable (Malignant or Benign)

---

## 🔍 Analysis Highlights

- 📈 Distribution of Malignant vs Benign tumors.
- 📊 Feature comparisons across diagnosis classes.
- 🧩 Correlation Heatmap to identify feature interdependencies.
- 📉 Insights into the most impactful features contributing to cancer prediction.

## 📌 How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Load `Cancer.csv` (or a pre-cleaned version) into Power BI.
3. Use drag-and-drop visuals or Python scripting to explore the data.
4. Customize visualizations as needed for further insights.
